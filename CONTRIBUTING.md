# Contribution guidelines

- Do not complain that a device is not included, just send a pull request to add it. All that's needed is editing screens.json.
- **When adding a device, please do not include `"ppi"` if it can be calculated.** It should only have a value when the manufacturer-reported ppi is different than what can be calculated.
- Please maintain alphabetical ordering for the devices.
- Please test your json file for syntax errors before sending a pull request.
